# gcloud logging sinks

manages sinks used to route logs to storage or export destinations

### `gcloud logging sinks create`

Create a log sink

Create a log sink used to route log entries to a destination. The sink
routes all log entries that match its --log-filter flag.

An empty filter matches all logs.

Detailed information about filters can be found at:
https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logging-query-language

The sink's destination can be a Cloud Logging log bucket, a Cloud Storage
bucket, a BigQuery dataset, a Cloud Pub/Sub topic, or a Google Cloud
project.

The destination must already exist.

If creating a log sink to route logs to a destination outside of Cloud
Logging or to a Cloud Logging log bucket in another project, the log sink's
service account must be granted permission to write to the destination.

For more information about destination permissions, see:
https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2#dest-auth

Matching log entries are routed to the destination after the sink is
created.

**Synopsis:**
```
gcloud logging sinks create SINK_NAME DESTINATION
    [--custom-writer-identity=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]
    [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--disabled]
    [--exclusion=[description=DESCRIPTION],
      [disabled=DISABLED],[filter=FILTER],[name=NAME]] [--include-children]
    [--intercept-children] [--log-filter=LOG_FILTER]
    [--use-partitioned-tables]
    [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
      | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
    [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]
```

**Positional arguments:**
```
SINK_NAME
   The name for the sink.

DESTINATION
   The destination for the sink.
```

**Optional flags:**

| Flag | Value | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--custom-writer-identity` | SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL |  | Writer identity for the sink. This flag can only be used if the destination is a log bucket in a different project. The writer identity is automatically generated when it is not provided for a sink. |
| `--description` | DESCRIPTION |  | Description of the sink. |
| `--disabled` |  |  | Sink will be disabled. Disabled sinks do not export logs. |
| `--exclusion` | [description=DESCRIPTION],[disabled=DISABLED],[filter=FILTER],[name=NAME] |  | Specify an exclusion filter for a log entry that is not to be exported. This flag can be repeated. The name and filter attributes are required. The following keys are accepted: name An identifier, such as load-balancer-exclusion. Identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only letters, digits, underscores, hyphens, and periods. description A description of this exclusion. filter An advanced log filter that matches the log entries to be excluded. disabled If this exclusion should be disabled and not exclude the log entries. |
| `--include-children` |  |  | Whether to export logs from all child projects and folders. Only applies to sinks for organizations and folders. |
| `--intercept-children` |  |  | Whether to intercept logs from all child projects and folders. Only applies to sinks for organizations and folders. |
| `--log-filter` | LOG_FILTER |  | A filter expression for the sink. If present, the filter specifies which log entries to export. |


**Examples:**
```bash
To route all Google Compute Engine logs to BigQuery, run:

    $ gcloud logging sinks create my-bq-sink \
        bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/datasets/\
    my_dataset --log-filter='resource.type="gce_instance"'

To route "syslog" from App Engine Flexible to a Cloud Storage bucket, run:

    $ gcloud logging sinks create my-gcs-sink \
        storage.googleapis.com/my-bucket \
        --log-filter='logName="projects/my-project/appengine.googleapis.\
    com%2Fsyslog"'

To route Google App Engine logs with ERROR severity, run:

    $ gcloud logging sinks create my-error-logs \
        bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/datasets/\
    my_dataset --log-filter='resource.type="gae_app" AND severity=ERROR'

To route all logs to a log bucket in a different project, run:

    $ gcloud logging sinks create my-sink \
        logging.googleapis.com/projects/my-central-project/locations/\
    global/buckets/my-central-bucket

To route all logs to another project, run:

    $ gcloud logging sinks create my-sink \
        logging.googleapis.com/projects/my-destination-project
```

### `gcloud logging sinks delete`

Delete a sink

Delete a sink and halt the export of log entries associated with that sink.
Deleting a sink does not affect log entries already exported through the
deleted sink, and will not affect other sinks that are exporting the same
log(s).

**Synopsis:**
```
gcloud logging sinks delete SINK_NAME
    [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
      | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
    [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]
```

**Positional arguments:**
```
SINK_NAME
   The name of the sink to delete.
```

**Optional flags:**

| Flag | Value | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--billing-account` | BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID |  | _[At most one of these can be specified:]_ Billing account of the sink to delete. |
| `--folder` | FOLDER_ID |  | _[At most one of these can be specified:]_ Folder of the sink to delete. |
| `--organization` | ORGANIZATION_ID |  | _[At most one of these can be specified:]_ Organization of the sink to delete. |
| `--project` | PROJECT_ID |  | _[At most one of these can be specified:]_ Project of the sink to delete. The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted, then the current project is assumed; the current project can be listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID. --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota, and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing, use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property. |


**Examples:**
```bash
To delete a sync 'my-bq-sync':

    $ gcloud logging sinks delete my-bq-sink
```
