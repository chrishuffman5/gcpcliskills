### `gcloud scc findings list`

List an organization or source's findings

List an organization or source's findings. To list across all sources
provide a '-' as the source id.

**Synopsis:**
```
gcloud scc findings list [PARENT] [--compare-duration=COMPARE_DURATION]
    [--field-mask=FIELD_MASK] [--location=LOCATION; default="global"]
    [--order-by=ORDER_BY] [--page-token=PAGE_TOKEN] [--read-time=READ_TIME]
    [--source=SOURCE; default="-"]
    [--folder=FOLDER | --organization=ORGANIZATION | --project=PROJECT]
    [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
    [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]
```

**Positional arguments:**
```
Parent resource - parent organization, folder, or project in the Google
Cloud resource hierarchy to be used for the gcloud scc command. Specify
the argument as either [RESOURCE_TYPE/RESOURCE_ID] or [RESOURCE_ID], as
shown in the preceding examples. This represents a Cloud resource.

  [PARENT]
     ID of the parent or fully qualified identifier for the parent.

     To set the parent attribute:
     + provide the argument parent on the command line;
     + Set the parent property in configuration using gcloud config set
       scc/parent if it is not specified in command line.
```

**Optional flags:**

| Flag | Value | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--compare-duration` | COMPARE_DURATION |  | (DEPRECATED) When compare_duration is set, the result's "state_change" attribute is updated to indicate whether the finding had its state changed, the finding's state remained unchanged, or if the finding was added during the compare_duration period of time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and read_time. The state_change value is derived based on the presence and state of the finding at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the result. For example, the results aren't affected if the finding is made inactive and then active again. Possible "state_change" values when compare_duration is specified: * 'CHANGED': indicates that the finding was present at the start of compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time. * 'UNCHANGED': indicates that the finding was present at the start of compare_duration and did not change state at read_time. * 'ADDED': indicates that the finding was not present at the start of compare_duration, but was present at read_time. * 'REMOVED': indicates that the finding was present at the start of compare_duration, but was not present at read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change is 'UNUSED', which will be the state_change set for all findings present at read_time. If this field is set then 'state_change' must be a specified field in 'group_by'. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on supported duration formats. The --compare-duration option is deprecated. For more information, see the deprecation notice (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/release-notes#April_15_2024) on the SCC release notes page. |
| `--field-mask` | FIELD_MASK |  | Field mask to specify the finding fields listed in the response. An empty field mask will list all fields. For example: --field-mask="finding.category,finding.resource_name" will only output category and resource_name for the findings in addition to default attributes. Notice the difference between hyphens (-) used with flags v/s camel case used in field masks. An empty or missing field mask will list all fields. |
| `--location` | LOCATION | global | When data residency controls are enabled, this attribute specifies the location in which the resource is located and applicable. The location attribute can be provided as part of the fully specified resource name or with the --location argument on the command line. The default location is global. NOTE: If you override the endpoint to a regional endpoint (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/index.html?rep_location=global#regional-service-endpoint) you must specify the correct data location (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/data-residency-support#locations) using this flag. The default location on this command is unrelated to the default location that is specified when data residency controls are enabled for Security Command Center. NOTE: If no location is specified, the default location is global AND the request will be routed to the SCC V1 API. To use the SCC V2 API - please explicitly specify the flag. |
| `--order-by` | ORDER_BY |  | Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting. String value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of fields. For example: "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For example: --order-by="name desc,source_properties.a_property" will order by name in descending order while source_properties.a_property in ascending order. |
| `--page-token` | PAGE_TOKEN |  | Response objects will return a non-null value for page-token to indicate that there is at least one additional page of data. User can either directly request that page by specifying the page-token explicitly or let gcloud fetch one-page-at-a-time. |
| `--read-time` | READ_TIME |  | (DEPRECATED) Time used as a reference point when filtering. Absence of this field will default to the API's version of NOW. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on supported time formats. The --read-time option is deprecated. For more information, see the deprecation notice (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/release-notes#April_15_2024) on the SCC release notes page. |
| `--source` | SOURCE | - | Source id. Defaults to all sources. |

| `--source` | SOURCE | - | Source id. Defaults to all sources. |
| `--source-properties` | [KEY=VALUE,...] |  | Source specific properties. These properties are managed by the source that writes the finding. The key names in the source_properties map must be between 1 and 255 characters, and must start with a letter and contain alphanumeric characters or underscores only. For example "key1=val1,key2=val2" |
| `--state` | one of: active, inactive, state-unspecified |  | State is one of: [ACTIVE, INACTIVE]. STATE must be one of: active, inactive, state-unspecified. |
| `--update-mask` | UPDATE_MASK |  | Optional: If left unspecified (default), an update-mask is automatically created using the flags specified in the command and only those values are updated. For example: --external-uri='<some-uri>' --event-time='<some-time>' would automatically generate --update-mask='external_uri,event_time'. Note that as a result, only external-uri and event-time are updated for the given finding and everything else remains untouched. If you want to delete attributes/properties (that are not being changed in the update command) use an empty update-mask (''). That will delete all the mutable properties/attributes that aren't specified as flags in the update command. In the above example it would delete source-properties. State can be toggled from ACTIVE to INACTIVE and vice-versa but it cannot be deleted. |


**Examples:**
```bash
Update testFinding's state from ACTIVE to INACTIVE:

    $ gcloud scc findings update `testFinding` --organization=123456 \
        --source=5678 --state=INACTIVE

Update testFinding's state from ACTIVE to INACTIVE using project name for
example-project:

    $ gcloud scc findings update \
        projects/example-project/sources/5678/findings/testFinding \
        --state=INACTIVE

Update testFinding's state from ACTIVE to INACTIVE using folder name 456:

    $ gcloud scc findings update \
        folders/456/sources/5678/findings/testFinding --state=INACTIVE

Override all source properties on testFinding:

    $ gcloud scc findings update `testFinding` --organization=123456 \
        --source=5678 \
        --source-properties="propKey1=propVal1,propKey2=propVal2"

Selectively update a specific source property on testFinding:

    $ gcloud scc findings update `testFinding` --organization=123456 \
        --source=5678 \
        --source-properties="propKey1=propVal1,propKey2=propVal2" \
        --update-mask="source_properties.propKey1"

Update finding testFinding with location=eu, state from ACTIVE to INACTIVE:

    $ gcloud scc findings update `testFinding` --organization=123456 \
        --source=5678 --state=INACTIVE --location=eu
```

### `gcloud scc findings update-marks`

Update Security Command Center finding's security marks

Update Security Command Center finding's security marks.

**Synopsis:**
```
gcloud scc findings update-marks FINDING
    [--location=LOCATION; default="global"]
    [--security-marks=[KEY=VALUE,...]] [--source=SOURCE; default="-"]
    [--start-time=START_TIME] [--update-mask=UPDATE_MASK]
    [--folder=FOLDER | --organization=ORGANIZATION | --project=PROJECT]
    [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]
```

**Positional arguments:**
```
FINDING
   ID of the finding or fully qualified identifier for the finding.
```

**Optional flags:**

| Flag | Value | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--location` | LOCATION | global | When data residency controls are enabled, this attribute specifies the location in which the resource is located and applicable. The location attribute can be provided as part of the fully specified resource name or with the --location argument on the command line. The default location is global. NOTE: If you override the endpoint to a regional endpoint (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/index.html?rep_location=global#regional-service-endpoint) you must specify the correct data location (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/data-residency-support#locations) using this flag. The default location on this command is unrelated to the default location that is specified when data residency controls are enabled for Security Command Center. NOTE: If no location is specified, the default location is global AND the request will be routed to the SCC V1 API. To use the SCC V2 API - please explicitly specify the flag. |
| `--security-marks` | [KEY=VALUE,...] |  | SecurityMarks resource to be passed as the request body. It's a key=value pair separated by comma (,). For example: --security-marks="key1=val1,key2=val2". |
| `--source` | SOURCE | - | Source id. Defaults to all sources. |
| `--start-time` | START_TIME |  | Time at which the updated SecurityMarks take effect. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on supported time formats. |
| `--update-mask` | UPDATE_MASK |  | Use update-mask if you want to selectively update marks represented by --security-marks flag. For example: --update-mask="marks.key1,marks.key2". If you want to override all the marks for the given finding either skip the update-mask flag or provide an empty value (--update-mask '') for it. |


**Examples:**
```bash
Selectively update security mark Key1 with value v1 on testFinding. Note
that other security marks on testFinding are untouched:

    $ gcloud scc findings update-marks `testFinding` \
        --organization=123456 --source=5678 --security-marks="key1=v1" \
        --update-mask="marks.markKey1"

Update all security marks on testFinding, under project example-project and
source 5678:

    $ gcloud scc findings update-marks \
        projects/example-project/sources/5678/findings/testFinding \
        --security-marks="key1=v1,key2=v2"

Update all security marks on testFinding, under folder 456 and source 5678:

    $ gcloud scc findings update-marks \
        folders/456/sources/5678/findings/testFinding \
        --security-marks="key1=v1,key2=v2"

Update all security marks on testFinding, under organization 123456 and
source 5678:

    $ gcloud scc findings update-marks `testFinding` \
        --organization=123456 --source=5678 \
        --security-marks="key1=v1,key2=v2"

Delete all security marks on testFinding:

    $ gcloud scc findings update-marks `testFinding` \
        --organization=123456 --source=5678 --security-marks=""

Update all security marks on testFinding, under project example-project,
source 5678 and location=eu:

    $ gcloud scc findings update-marks \
        projects/example-project/sources/5678/findings/testFinding \
        --security-marks="key1=v1,key2=v2" --location=eu
