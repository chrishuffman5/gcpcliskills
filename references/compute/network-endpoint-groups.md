    [--network-endpoint-type=NETWORK_ENDPOINT_TYPE;
      default="gce-vm-ip-port"] [--producer-port=PRODUCER_PORT]

    [--global | --region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]
```

**Positional arguments:**
```
NAME
   Name of the network endpoint group to operate on.
```

**Optional flags:**

| Flag | Value | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--default-port` | DEFAULT_PORT |  | The default port to use if the port number is not specified in the network endpoint. If this flag isn't specified for a NEG with endpoint type gce-vm-ip-port, gce-vm-ip-portmap or non-gcp-private-ip-port, then every network endpoint in the network endpoint group must have a port specified. For a global NEG with endpoint type internet-ip-port and internet-fqdn-port if the default port is not specified, the well-known port for your backend protocol is used (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS). This flag is not supported for NEGs with endpoint type serverless. This flag is not supported for NEGs with endpoint type private-service-connect. |
| `--network` | NETWORK |  | Name of the network in which the NEG is created. default project network is used if unspecified. This is only supported for NEGs with endpoint type gce-vm-ip-port, non-gcp-private-ip-port, gce-vm-ip, private-service-connect, internet-ip-port, internet-fqdn-port, or gce-vm-ip-portmap. For Private Service Connect NEGs, you can optionally specify --network and --subnet if --psc-target-service points to a published service. If --psc-target-service points to the regional service endpoint of a Google API, do not specify --network or --subnet. |
| `--network-endpoint-type` | one of: gce-vm-ip-port, internet-ip-port, internet-fqdn-port, non-gcp-private-ip-port, serverless, gce-vm-ip, private-service-connect, gce-vm-ip-portmap | gce-vm-ip-port | Determines the spec of endpoints attached to this group. gce-vm-ip-port Endpoint IP address must belong to a VM in Compute Engine (either the primary IP or as part of an aliased IP range). The --default-port must be specified or every network endpoint in the network endpoint group must have a port specified. internet-ip-port Endpoint IP address must be a publicly routable address. If specified, the default port is used. If unspecified, the well-known port for your backend protocol is used as the default port (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS). internet-fqdn-port Endpoint FQDN must be resolvable to a public IP address via public DNS. The default port is used, if specified. If the default port is not specified, the well-known port for your backend protocol is used as the default port (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS). After creating a NEG of this type, you can use the gcloud compute network-endpoint-groups update command with the --add-endpoint flag. Example: --add-endpoint="fqdn=backend.example.com,port=443" non-gcp-private-ip-port Endpoint IP address must belong to a VM not in Compute Engine and must be routable using a Cloud Router over VPN or an Interconnect connection. In this case, the NEG must be zonal. The --default-port must be specified or every network endpoint in the network endpoint group must have a port specified. serverless The network endpoint is handled by specified serverless infrastructure, such as Cloud Run, App Engine, or Cloud Function. Default port, network, and subnet are not effective for serverless endpoints. private-service-connect The network endpoint corresponds to a service outside the VPC, accessed via Private Service Connect. gce-vm-ip Endpoint must be the IP address of a VM's network interface in Compute Engine. Instance reference is required. The IP address is optional. If unspecified, the primary NIC address is used. A port must not be specified. gce-vm-ip-portmap Endpoint IP address must be a primary IP of a VM's network interface in Compute Engine. The --default-port must be specified or every network endpoint in the network endpoint group must have a port specified. NETWORK_ENDPOINT_TYPE must be one of: gce-vm-ip-port, internet-ip-port, internet-fqdn-port, non-gcp-private-ip-port, serverless, gce-vm-ip, private-service-connect, gce-vm-ip-portmap. |
| `--producer-port` | PRODUCER_PORT |  | The producer port to use when a consumer PSC NEG connects to a producer's internal network load balancer. If this flag isn't specified for a NEG with endpoint type private-service-connect, the PSC NEG will connect to port 443 or the first available port in the PSC producer port range, or to port 1 if the PSC producer's forwarding rule ports flag is set to all-ports. This flag is not supported for NEGs with endpoint type other than private-service-connect. |
| `--psc-target-service` | PSC_TARGET_SERVICE |  | PSC target service name to add to the private service connect network endpoint groups (NEG). |
| `--subnet` | SUBNET |  | Name of the subnet to which all network endpoints belong. If not specified, network endpoints may belong to any subnetwork in the region where the network endpoint group is created. This is only supported for NEGs with endpoint type gce-vm-ip-port, gce-vm-ip, private-service-connect, or gce-vm-ip-portmap. For Private Service Connect NEGs, you can optionally specify --network and --subnet if --psc-target-service points to a published service. If --psc-target-service points to the regional service endpoint of a Google API, do not specify --network or --subnet. |


**Examples:**
```bash
To create a network endpoint group:

    $ gcloud compute network-endpoint-groups create my-neg \
        --zone=us-central1-a --network=my-network --subnet=my-subnetwork
```
