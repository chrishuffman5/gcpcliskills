### `gcloud compute machine-images import`

Create a Compute Engine machine image from virtual appliance in OVA/OVF format

(DEPRECATED) This command is being deprecated. Instead, use the gcloud
migration vms machine-image-imports command. For more information, See
"gcloud alpha migration vms machine-image-imports --help".

gcloud compute machine-images import creates Compute Engine machine image
from virtual appliance in OVA/OVF format.

Importing OVF involves:
  o Unpacking OVF package (if in OVA format) to Cloud Storage.
  o Import disks from OVF to Compute Engine.
  o Translate the boot disk to make it bootable in Compute Engine.
  o Create a machine image using OVF metadata and imported disks.

Virtual instances, images, machine images, and disks in Compute engine and
files stored on Cloud Storage incur charges. See

|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--no-address` |  |  | Temporary VMs are created in your project during machine image import. Set this flag so that these temporary VMs are not assigned external IP addresses. Note: The machine image import process requires package managers to be installed on the operating system for the virtual disk. These package managers might need to make requests to package repositories that are outside Google Cloud. To allow access for these updates, you need to configure Cloud NAT and Private Google Access. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/gce-example#create-nat and https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-access-options#pga. |
| `--async` |  |  | Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to complete. |

Cloud Build uses a specific service account to execute builds on your behalf. The Cloud Build service account generates an access token for other service accounts and it is also used for authentication when building the artifacts for the image import tool. Use this flag to to specify a user-managed service account for image import and export. If you don't specify this flag, Cloud Build runs using your project's default Cloud Build service account. To set this option, specify the email address of the desired user-managed service account. Note: You must specify the --logs-location flag when you set a user-managed service account. At minimum, the specified user-managed service account needs to have the following roles assigned: * roles/compute.admin * roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator * roles/iam.serviceAccountUser |
| `--compute-service-account` | COMPUTE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT |  | A temporary virtual machine instance is created in your project during machine image import. Machine image import tooling on this temporary instance must be authenticated. A Compute Engine service account is an identity attached to an instance. Its access tokens can be accessed through the instance metadata server and can be used to authenticate machine image import tooling on the instance. To set this option, specify the email address corresponding to the required Compute Engine service account. If not provided, the machine image import on the temporary instance uses the project's default Compute Engine service account.
