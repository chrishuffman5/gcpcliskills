### `gcloud edge-cache origins create`

Create an EdgeCacheOrigin resource

Create a new EdgeCacheOrigin resource.

**Synopsis:**
```
gcloud edge-cache origins create (ORIGIN : --location=LOCATION)
    --origin-address=ORIGIN_ADDRESS [--async] [--description=DESCRIPTION]
    [--failover-origin=FAILOVER_ORIGIN] [--flex-shielding=FLEX_SHIELDING]
    [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]] [--max-attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS] [--port=PORT]
    [--protocol=PROTOCOL] [--response-timeout=RESPONSE_TIMEOUT]
    [--retry-conditions=[RETRY_CONDITIONS,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]
```

**Positional arguments:**
```
Origin resource - The name of the EdgeCacheOrigin resource to create. The
arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
can be set in other ways.

To set the project attribute:
 * provide the argument origin on the command line with a fully
   specified name;
 * provide the argument --project on the command line;
 * set the property core/project.

This must be specified.

  ORIGIN
     ID of the origin or fully qualified identifier for the origin.

     To set the origin attribute:
     + provide the argument origin on the command line.

     This positional argument must be specified if any of the other
     arguments in this group are specified.

  --location=LOCATION
     The location Id.

     To set the location attribute:
     + provide the argument origin on the command line with a fully
       specified name;
     + provide the argument --location on the command line;
     + use global location.
```

**Required flags:**

| Flag | Value | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--origin-address` | ORIGIN_ADDRESS |  | A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address reachable over the public Internet, or the address of a Google Cloud Storage bucket. This address will be used as the origin for cache requests - e.g. * FQDN: media-backend.example.com * IPv4: 35.218.1.1 * IPv6: [2607:f8b0:4012:809::200e] * Cloud Storage: gs://bucketname When providing an FQDN (hostname), it must be publicly resolvable (e.g. via Google public DNS) and IP addresses must be publicly routable. If a Cloud Storage bucket is provided, it must be in the canonical "gs://bucketname" format. Other forms, such as "storage.googleapis.com", will be rejected. |


**Optional flags:**

| Flag | Value | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--async` |  |  | Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to complete. |
| `--description` | DESCRIPTION |  | Human-readable description of the resource. |
| `--failover-origin` | FAILOVER_ORIGIN |  | Origin resource to try when the current origin cannot be reached. After maxAttempts is reached, the configured failoverOrigin will be used to fulfil the request. For example, the following are both valid URLs to an EdgeCacheOrigin resource: * /projects/PROJECT/locations/global/edgeCacheOrigins/yourOrigin * yourOrigin The value of timeout.maxAttemptsTimeout dictates the timeout across all origins. |
| `--flex-shielding` | one of: ** Turn off flexible shielding and use the default global origin shielding |  | Whenever possible, content will be fetched from origin and cached in or near the specified region. Best effort. Defaults to default global origin shielding. You may specify at most one region. An empty flag turns off flex shielding. FLEX_SHIELDING must be one of: ** Turn off flexible shielding and use the default global origin shielding. africa_south1 Origin fetch from near africa-south1. me_central1 Origin fetch from near me-central1. |
| `--labels` | [KEY=VALUE,...] |  | List of KEY=VALUE labels to attach to this resource. |
| `--max-attempts` | MAX_ATTEMPTS |  | Maximum number of attempts to cache fill from this origin. Another attempt is made when a cache fill fails with one of the retry_conditions. Once max_attempts to this origin have failed the failover_origin will be used, if one is specified. That failover_origin may specify its own max_attempts, retry_conditions and failover_origin to control its own cache fill failures. The total number of allowed attempts to cache fill across this and failover origins is limited to four. The total time allowed for cache fill attempts across this and failover origins can be controlled with max_attempts_timeout. The last valid response from an origin will be returned to the client. If no origin returns a valid response, an HTTP 503 will be returned to the client. Defaults to 1. Must be a value greater than 0 and less than 4. |
| `--port` | PORT |  | Port to connect to the origin on. Defaults to port 443 for HTTP2 and HTTPS protocols, and port 80 for HTTP. |
| `--protocol` | one of: http HTTP without TLS (SSL) |  | Protocol to use to connect to the configured origin. Defaults to HTTP2, and it is strongly recommended that users use HTTP2 for both security & performance. When using HTTP2 or HTTPS as the protocol, a valid, publicly-signed, unexpired TLS (SSL) certificate must be presented by the origin server. PROTOCOL must be one of: http HTTP without TLS (SSL). This is not recommended, as communication outside of Google's network will be unencrypted to the public endpoint (origin). http2 HTTP/2 protocol. HTTP/2 refers to "h2", which requires TLS (HTTPS). Requires a valid (public, unexpired) TLS certificate to be present on the origin. https HTTP/1.1 with TLS (SSL). Requires a valid (public, unexpired) TLS certificate to be present on the origin. |
| `--response-timeout` | RESPONSE_TIMEOUT |  | Maximum duration to wait for data to arrive when reading from the HTTP connection/stream. Defaults to 5 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 30s. |
| `--retry-conditions` | one of: connect-failure, forbidden, gateway-error, http-5xx, not-found, retriable-4xx, retry-conditions-unspecified |  | Specifies one or more retry conditions for the configured origin. If the failure mode during a connection attempt to the origin matches the configured retryCondition(s), the origin request will be retried up to maxAttempts times. The failoverOrigin, if configured, will then be used to satisfy the request. The default retryCondition is "connect-failure". retryConditions apply to this origin, and not subsequent failoverOrigin(s), which may specify their own retryConditions and maxAttempts. Valid values are: * connect-failure: Retry on failures connecting to origins, for example due to connection timeouts. * http-5xx: Retry if the origin responds with any 5xx response code, or if the origin does not respond at all, example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused streams. * gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes 502, 503 or 504. * retriable-4xx: Retry for retriable 4xx response codes, which include HTTP 409 (Conflict) and HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) * not-found: Retry if the origin returns a HTTP 404 (Not Found). This can be useful when generating video content, and the segment is not available yet. RETRY_CONDITIONS must be one of: connect-failure, forbidden, gateway-error, http-5xx, not-found, retriable-4xx, retry-conditions-unspecified. |


**Examples:**
```bash
To create a EdgeCacheOrigin resource called 'my-origin', run:

    $ gcloud edge-cache origins create my-origin \
        --origin-address="origin.example.com"
